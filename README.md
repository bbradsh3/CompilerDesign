# Compiler Design Project

This repository contains a custom compiler built from scratch. It includes all essential stages of compilation, such as lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding compiler design principles and demonstrates how high-level language instructions are translated into machine-understandable code.

## Project Overview
The compiler takes in code written in a specific source language, processes it through various stages, and generates executable output. The primary stages covered in this project are:
- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes the input code.
- **Syntax Analysis (Parsing)**: Uses a grammar to build a parse tree.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Ensures that parsed code is meaningful.
- **Code Generation**: Produces output code in an intermediate or target format.

## Features
- **Custom Lexer**: Identifies keywords, operators, and symbols.
- **Parser Implementation**: Builds a syntax tree from tokenized code.
- **Semantic Checker**: Validates variable usage, types, and scopes.
- **Code Generation**: Produces output in an intermediate representation or as machine code.
